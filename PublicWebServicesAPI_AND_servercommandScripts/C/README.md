# Call the PaperCut XML-RPC web servies API from C

This very simple example shows how to use the xmlrpc-c
library to call a PaperCut server.

You will need to install the [xmlrpc-c](http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/)
library from packages, or build from source.

There is a sample makefile to build the code. Please pay
particular attention to the set up of XMLRPC_FLAGS.

Many thanks to Bryan Henderson from the xmlrpc-c project for help
in getting this to build.
