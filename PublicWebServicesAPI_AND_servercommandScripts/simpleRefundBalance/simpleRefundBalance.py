# Small webb app to allow a user to  request a refund of their personal PaperCut balance
# into another system

# Add a custom URL to the PaperCut user web page, which is used by end users
# when they want to request a refund from their PaperCut personal account. The url
# should refer to this small web app. When the user clicks on the URL link
# (in the PaperCut user web page) to the web app, the user identification details
# are passed as part of the URL. This is explained at:

# https://www.papercut.com/products/ng/manual/common/topics/customize-user-web-pages.html#customize-user-web-pages-nav-links

# The URL neeeds to something like http://localhost:8081/simpleRefundBalance/%user%

# This code is basic example only. It will require work before it can be used for production
